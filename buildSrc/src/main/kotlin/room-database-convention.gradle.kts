// This convention plugin has been DISABLED 
// It was trying to use "android-library-conventions" which we disabled due to compilation issues
//
// The plugin was also using the 'android' extension directly without proper configuration
// 
// If you need Room database conventions, consider:
// 1. Creating a class-based plugin like AndroidLibraryConventionPlugin.kt
// 2. Or applying Room dependencies directly in modules that need them
//
// This file is intentionally left empty to prevent build errors.
